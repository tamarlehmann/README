# Tamar Lehmann README

Here you'll find everything you need to know about me, my background and how I work best. If you have any questions, feel free to send me a message and ask!

## About Me

I started my tech career exactly two years ago in January 17, learning to code at Makers Academy. Previously, I was working in marketing analytics for an website after having studied psychology at univeristy. I joined AND in September 17 and am an Associate Product Developer AND Granola Chef in squad Cypher.
I grew up and still live in London, and in my free time I enjoy exploring the city finding cute coffee shops and trying new restaurants. I'm a social person and love spending most evenings and weekends catching up with friends and family (over food of course!). I also enjoy going to the gym, especially spinning and HIIT classes. If you're reading this and you love/want to try out Barry's Bootcamp with me let me know! 

## How I Work

* I don't often use headphones but when I do feel free to disturb me or slack me, whichever you prefer. If I'm busy I'll tell you and let you know when I am free to talk.
* I'm happy to task switch, however, if I have too many things going on I'll let you know.
* I ask TONS of questions, sorry in advance. If I'm asking too many let me know. Similarly, I'm more than happy to answer any questions you have, if I can of course!
* I am good at seeing the bigger picture and context but also have really good attention to detail. If you need something proof read or to get details out of a document, I’m your gal!

### I work best in an environment which:
* Isn't too loud, I need some space to think.
* Isn't too hot or cold.
* Has desks which allow you to pair, a monitor is handy too if there's one available.
* Has snacks and a coffee machine!

### My preferred meeting format:
* Is only having a meeting if it is totally necessary.
* Is having a meeting that lasts within an hour, or if required to be longer, has appropriate breaks for optimum concentration.
* Is having a clear agenda for the meeting.
* Is having the right people in the room so you don't waste anyone's time, and so the meeting doesn't have to be repeated.
* Is making sure the meeting has been prepared for, any slide decks, sheets, visual cues.
* Is taking appropriate notes and actions from the meeting.

### HBDI
I am dominant in Blue and Green, and as my profile suggests, I like to solve problems in a logical and thoughout way. I work well with a clear, organised plan of action. If you see me making to-do lists or tick-box lists on stories don't be alarmed. I have strong verbal communication skills, and can sometimes be quite emotional. However, this mostly comes out in stressful or frustrating situations where I become more Red.

### Traits that I value are:
* Reliability
* Hard Work
* Collaboration and support when neccessary
* Kindness

## Feedback
* I welcome constant and continuous feedback, if you've worked alongside me and have specific action points PLEASE let me know. I’m happy with recieving it written or face-to-face. Alternatively, I’ll also ask you if I want feedback on a particular area. I’ll try to be as specific as possible but please tell me if I’m not!
* I’m happy to give feedback in any format you wish. I’d prefer if you gave me areas you’d specifically like feedback on rather than it being general, although I’m happy to do either. If you opt for written feedback, I’ll be happy to discuss it face-to-face after. Of course, if you want it in a different form, always ask.

## Goals and Aspirations
* Short term, I just want to improve! In any way possible, whether that's my tech skills, my communication skills, my stakeholder management skills. I'm trying to work on everything. Specifically, my current short term tech goals and aspirations are related to core JavaScript and DevOps. This is a result of working on a back-end project. I like to target my goals around what I'm doing currently.
* Long Term, I'd like to be a full-stack developer, with an understanding of the cloud/devops, working on a product I am passionate about.
